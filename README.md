the apis designed in python relates to stocks project, it includes show all data api, get single company stock data, and calculate the cumulative retures

I am using import.py to import all thecsv file data. after analysis the data, I found that I could design two tables for this whole data: company table and stock_data table.

The apis works with localserver with MySQL database, and there are two tables one is company table and id as the foreign key in the table: <img width="594" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c6dd70-19a9-487a-8d75-2d764dc7c178">
